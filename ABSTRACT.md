Authors propose **CWFID** as a benchmark dataset for crop/weed discrimination, single plant phenotyping and other open computer vision tasks in precision agriculture. All images were acquired with the autonomous field robot Bonirob in an organic carrot farm while the carrot plants were in early true leaf growth stage. Intra- and inter-row weeds were present, weed and crop were approximately of the same size and grew close together. For every dataset image authors supply a ground truth vegetation segmentation mask and manual annotation of the plant type (crop vs. weed). Authors provide initial results for the phenotyping problem of crop/weed classification and propose evaluation methods to allow comparison of different approaches.
