**CWFID: A Crop/Weed Field Image Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the agricultural industry, and in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 60 images with 492 labeled objects belonging to 2 different classes including *crop* and *weed*. There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2015 by the Bosch Research and Leibniz Universitat Hannover.
